# This document will change with time, here is our first attempt at organising/transforming the different information into reusable, computer readable data.

Information can be gathered at different time and are valid for different experiment. We therefore organise the information into 4 categories:

- widelab: this is applied to the whole lab. For example protocols are in this category. Housing facility and conditions might also be in this category.
- lab_sheet: this info applies to copnditions for a large group of experiment.
- animal sheet: information present in the animal book 
- experiment_sheet: information available only when the experiment starts

Note that depending on the legislation, the animal book might be more or less complete and not all information put in the animal sheet category is entered in the book, but the fact that it could be is here determinant here.
